# Welcome to Advent of Code 2024!

Here are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 Competition. Overall, I managed to solve 48/50 stars in time without need of external help. For the remaining two, I needed to borrow inspiration and sometimes code from other repos (this is a mild way of admitting that I cheated :sweat_smile:). The borrowed code is cited whenever necessary.

## Dependencies
- Python `3.10.11`
- `numpy==2.1.3` (only used in a handful of challenges).
